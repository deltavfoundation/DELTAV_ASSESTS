# Delta V: Reaching the Unreached 🚀

**Delta V** is a student-led initiative dedicated to bridging the gap between school and college. We believe that peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and high-quality "learning roadmaps" are the keys to academic and professional success.

## 🌟 Our Mission
Delta V serves as a **Digital Research & Knowledge Hub**. Our goal is to provide students—regardless of their background or stream—with the resources they need to transition into higher education with confidence.

## 📂 What We Do
We operate as a **Passive Research Hub**, documenting our own learning journeys and technical projects to build a permanent library for others.

### 🔌 STEM & Electronics
* Technical documentation for DIY electronics projects.
* Circuit design research and hardware explainers.
* Engineering roadmap guides for beginners.

### ⚖️ Interdisciplinary Roadmaps (Arts, Law, & Business)
* Comprehensive guides on "What to expect" in different degree programs.
* Research pieces on the intersection of technology and society.
* Peer-curated resources for non-technical fields.

## 🏗️ Our Philosophy: Learn | Launch | Lead
1. **Learn:** We focus on mastering our own fields (Electronics, Law, Arts) through deep research.
2. **Launch:** We document that research into accessible, open-source repositories.
3. **Lead:** We empower the next generation of students by giving them the "roadmap" we wish we had.
